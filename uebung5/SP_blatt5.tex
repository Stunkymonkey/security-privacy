\section*{Problem 1: Schnorr’s protocol - special honest verifier zero-knowledge}

It is easy to see, that $(P, V)$ as given for Schnorr’s protocol has the form of a $\Sigma$-protocol with commitment $a$, challenge $e$ and response $z$.
The ``special honest verifier ZK'' property requires: $\exists$ ppt simulator $M$ such that $\forall x\in L_R$ and $e\in \{0,1\}^t: M(x, e) = Trans_{V^e}^P(x)$ where $Trans_{V^e}^P(x)$ is the Transcript of an interaction between (honest) $P$ and $V$ using challenge $e$ on input $x$ and equality refers to an identical distribution.
\\~\\
$M$ works as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Receive inputs $(\mathcal{G},q,g,h)$ and $e$.
\item Select $z\in\mathbb{Z}_q$ randomly.
\item Calculate $a = \frac{g^z}{h^e}\mod q$.
\item Output transcript $(a, e, z)$.
\end{itemize}\
\\
On the calculation of $a$:\\
We know from the protocol, that $P$ calculates $z$ as follows:
$$z=r+e\cdot w \mod q$$
Since $\mathcal{G}$ is cyclic with generator $g$:
$$g^z = g^{r+e\cdot w \mod q} = g^r \cdot g^{e\cdot w \mod q}$$
We also know:
$$g^r = a; g^w=h$$
$$\implies g^z = a \cdot h^e \mod q$$
$$a = \frac{g^z}{h^e} \mod q$$
\\
As for the probability distribution of a transcript of $(P,V^e)$, we know that $r\in \mathbb{Z}_q$ is selected randomly by the honest prover and thus $a = g^r$ is indirectly selected randomly as well with the same distribution as for $r$. Note again, that $\mathcal{G}$ is cyclic. $z$ on the other hand directly depends on the other values and can be calculated by a deterministic function, as it is actually performed by $P$.\\
We have the same probability distribution for $M$, as for $M$ $z\in \mathbb{Z}_q$ is selected at random. $a$ is then deterministically calculated from $e$ and $z$. Just the other way around.\\
More precisely we have the same probability space $(\Omega, 2^{\Omega}, P)$ in both cases, where
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Omega = \mathbb{Z}_q$
\item $P: 2^{\Omega} \rightarrow [0,1]$ is a uniform distribution.
\end{itemize}\
It follows from the above, that Schnorr's protocol fulfills the ``special honest verifier ZK'' property.

\section*{Problem 2: Homomorphic properties of algorithms}
$p=(\mathcal{G},q,g,h)$ fixed, $r_0, r_1, v_0, v_1 \in \mathbb{Z}_q$, we show:
$$com^{r_0+r_1}(p, v_0 + v_1) \overset{!}{=} com^{r_0}(p, v_0) \cdot com^{r_1}(p, v_1)$$
By just applying the definition of $com$ in the Pedersen commitment scheme, we know:
$$com^{r_0+r_1}(p, v_0 + v_1) = g^{v_0 + v_1}\cdot h^{r_0+r_1}$$
$$com^{r_0}(p, v_0) = g^{v_0} \cdot h^{r_0}$$
$$com^{r_1}(p, v_1) = g^{v_1} \cdot h^{r_1}$$
Thus:
$$com^{r_0}(p, v_0) \cdot com^{r_1}(p, v_1) = g^{v_0} \cdot h^{r_0} \cdot g^{v_1} \cdot h^{r_1}$$
$$= g^{v_0}\cdot g^{v_1}\cdot h^{r_0}\cdot h^{r_1}$$
$$= g^{v_0 + v_1}\cdot h^{r_0+r_1}$$
$$= com^{r_0+r_1}(p, v_0 + v_1)$$

% This definitely seems TOO EASY?!?

\section*{Problem 5: 51\%-Attack on Bitcoin}
Preliminary thoughts before the actual lecture on the topic:
\subsection*{(a)}
With 49\% of the hash-power a block is found within 20 minutes on average, i.e. 3 blocks per hour. Thus 51\% of the hash-power can find $\frac{3}{49\%}\cdot 51\% \approx 3.12245$ blocks per hour. The attacker needs to find 6 blocks more than the honest part of the network in the same time. This is: $t\cdot 0.12245 = 6$, which leads to $t \approx 49$ hours needed to catch up with the honest branch.
\subsection*{(b)}
In the calculated 49 hours the attacker generates $3.12245 \cdot 49 \approx 153$ new blocks. Obviously the difference between the earnings and costs for finding a block is $100,000$\EUR{}$ - 12.5\cdot 6,000$\EUR{}$ = 25,000$\EUR{}. Thus the attacker would need to make an additional $25,000$\EUR{} $\cdot 153 = 3,825,000$\EUR{} via double-spending to compensate his costs. Under the given circumstances $3,825,000$\EUR{} were worth approximately $637.5$\bitcoinA. To make a profit, the attacker would need to double-spend at least a bit more than the aforementioned amount.
\subsection*{(c)}
No idea so far.
